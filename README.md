> A chess engine written in Go.

Well, this is a chess engine highly inspired bt [chess-at-nite][chess-at-nite] which I have written several years ago with my friends in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since I am interested in writting an application in Golang I thought of doing chess.

## Ideas

* Make multi threaded with channels
* Use zobrist hash vor repetitions, score cache, etc.
